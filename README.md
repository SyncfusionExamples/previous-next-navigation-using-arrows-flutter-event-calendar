# How to navigate to the previous or next views using navigation arrows in the Flutter Calendar

A quick-start example to help you to navigate to the previous or next views using navigation arrows in the Flutter Calendar.

You can navigate to the previous or next view in the Flutter Event Calendar without swiping by using the [showNavigationArrow](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/showNavigationArrow.html) in calendar property. The showNavigationArrow property is not applicable when the view is set to CalendarView.schedule.

By changing the header [textAlign](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/CalendarHeaderStyle/textAlign.html), you can adjust the arrow position in the header.
